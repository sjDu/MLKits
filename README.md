# ML Kits

Machine Learning play ground.
Using tensorflow and mathematics analysis to implement some ML models from scratch.

- Linear Regression (gradient descent - batch) : regressions/linear-regression/linear-regression.js
- Logistic Regression (gradient - descent) : /regressions/logistic-regression/logistic-regression.js
- knn (using just lodash) :/plinko/score.js
- knn (using tensorflow) :/knn-tf/index.js
