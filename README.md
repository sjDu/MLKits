Machine Learning play ground.
Using tensorflow and mathematics analysis to implement some ML models from scratch.

- knn (using just lodash) :/plinko/score.js
- knn (using tensorflow) :/knn-tf/index.js
- Linear Regression (gradient descent - batch) : regressions/linear-regression/linear-regression.js
    - auto update learning rate
    - batch size training
    - standardize
- Logistic Regression (gradient descent) : /regressions/logistic-regression/logistic-regression.js
    - decisionBoundary
- Multinominal Logistic Regression: /regressions/multinominal-logistic-regression/logistic-regression.js
    - multi-labels
